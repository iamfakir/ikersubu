# Website Enhancement Plan for R&B/Hip-Hop Mix Engineer

## Critical Issues (Blocking/Functional)
- [ ] Add robust error boundaries around all dynamic imports
- [ ] Gracefully handle empty state in CardCarousel (show placeholder, disable nav)
- [ ] Guard getVisibleCards() against empty sortedFilteredItems

## High Priority (Accessibility & Core UX)
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to every interactive element
- [ ] Implement complete keyboard navigation for carousels and modals
- [ ] Fix color-contrast failures to meet WCAG AA
- [ ] Provide explicit loading states for all async operations

## Medium Priority (Performance)
- [ ] Remove redundant isClient guard (or ssr:false) in CardCarousel
- [ ] Normalize loading-placeholder heights to prevent layout shift
- [ ] Optimize heavy animations and add will-change where appropriate

## Low Priority (Code Quality & Maintainability)
- [ ] Strengthen TypeScript types (e.g., refine PortfolioItem)
- [ ] Eliminate redundant state updates in Home component
- [ ] Optimize event handlers to avoid memory leaks
- [ ] Wrap expensive components with React.memo/useMemo where beneficial
