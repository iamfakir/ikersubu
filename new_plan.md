# Website Improvement Plan

## Clarity and Focus
*   Clearly state your core service, avoiding dilution by overly niche offerings unless they are contextualised.
*   Ensure service descriptions detail the value proposition for your specific target clients, especially within R&B and Hip Hop.
*   Prioritise "Mixing" as the most prominent service.
*   Target website content to the specific needs and pain points of your ideal clients, rather than trying to impress other professionals.
*   Clearly define what is included in each price tier.

## Content and Information
*   Prominently showcase your best work and portfolio with audio examples where possible. You only need one strong demo to start.
*   Create a compelling narrative or "About Me" page that tells your story and humanizes your brand, including high-profile experiences.
*   Include clear contact details and easy ways for clients to get in touch.
*   Actively solicit and display testimonials, press quotes, or client reviews.
*   Leverage high-profile credits (e.g., A$AP Rocky, Squid Game 2) by detailing your specific contributions and the transferable lessons learned.
*   Remove or update any "coming soon" messages that are not yet implemented to maintain professionalism.
*   Show yourself to the world by including images or videos of you working and engaging with clients.
*   Include live performance dates and commercial work examples.

## User Experience (UX) & Design
*   Invest in an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and user-friendly.
*   Use high-quality, high-resolution images and videos.
*   Maintain consistent branding, including your logo and colour themes, across all platforms.
*   Ensure fast loading times and mobile responsiveness.
*   Organise content logically with descriptive labels.
*   Make it simple for visitors to play audio tracks and experience your music, placing interactive elements like video reels and playlists at the forefront.
*   Use professional formatting and packaging for any digital products like sound kits.

## Marketing & SEO
*   Use relevant keywords throughout your website copy to improve search engine visibility.
*   Integrate clear calls to action (CTAs) to guide visitors.
*   Consider offering personalised recommendations or customised bundles/discounts to enhance customer loyalty.
*   Optimise your Instagram bio with keywords, key credits, a clear value proposition, and a link aggregator (e.g., Linktree).
*   Implement a consistent content strategy (3-5 high-quality posts per week) on social media, focusing on credibility, behind-the-scenes glimpses, value, testimonials, and engagement.
*   Research and use a mix of broad and niche-specific hashtags, avoiding generic ones.
*   Actively engage with followers by replying to comments and DMs promptly.
*   Define ideal client profiles (ICP) for targeted outreach and tailor messaging to these personas.
*   Implement a systematic and personalised Instagram DM outreach approach, starting with genuine compliments before pitching services.
*   Track all outreach activities meticulously.
*   Promote sound kits via Instagram, YouTube, email lists, and collaborations, offering bundles and special offers.
*   Prioritise driving traffic to your personal website for sound kit purchases to maximise profit.
